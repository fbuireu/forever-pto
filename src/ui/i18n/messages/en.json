          "answer": "Forever PTO is a tool to help you plan and optimize your paid time off (PTO) by suggesting the best dates to take off based on public holidays and your preferences. Given the complexity of holiday planning, Forever PTO aims to simplify the process and maximize your free time. Allowing you to choose different strategies to balance your time off throughout the year to maximize your time off. Allowing you to fully customize the holidays, the names of the festivities and even add custom holidays specific to your company or region."

The paid model funds updates, support and hosting. We also offer a free tier with core features to ensure everyone can benefit from better PTO planning.

          "question": "What is the difference between \"balanced\" and \"optimized\" strategies?",
