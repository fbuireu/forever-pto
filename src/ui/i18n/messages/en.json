		"questions": {
			"whatIsPremium": {
				"question": "What is Premium and why does it exist?",
				"answer": "The application is completely free and functional. However, there are some premium features behind a symbolic voluntary payment. This allows me to cover servers, domain, and various features that have associated costs, since this site doesn't rely on advertising."
			},
			"alreadyPaidDevice": {
				"question": "I already paid/donated on another device. Do I have to pay again?",
				"answer": "No. If you have already paid, you just need to enter the email used during payment. If an entry exists in our database, you will be granted premium benefits again. If you have questions or problems, please use the contact form."
			},
			"individualVsBlocks": {
				"question": "Why does it suggest individual days instead of long blocks?",
				"answer": "When strategic individual days (e.g., adjacent to holidays) generate more total free days than a long block, the algorithm prioritizes them for maximum effectiveness. The optimizer always chooses the combination that gives you the most time off."
			},
			"allPtoUsage": {
				"question": "Why does it use all my PTO days?",
				"answer": "The optimizer is designed to maximize your time off by using all available PTO days. If you don't want to use all your days, simply enter a lower number than your actual PTO allowance."
			},
			"blockSizes": {
				"question": "Why are blocks limited to 1-5 consecutive days?",
				"answer": "This range covers most practical vacation patterns: 1 day for strategic days adjacent to holidays/weekends, 2-3 days for long weekends, and 4-5 days for standard vacation weeks. Longer blocks (6+ days) are rare and usually less efficient than splitting into smaller strategic blocks."
			},
			"weekendsHandling": {
				"question": "How are weekends handled?",
				"answer": "Only weekends adjacent to PTO days or holidays are considered valuable. Isolated weekends don't add value to the optimization since you already have them off."
			},
			"pastDates": {
				"question": "Can I include past dates?",
				"answer": "You can toggle whether past dates are allowed in the settings. When disabled, only future dates are considered for suggestions."
			},
			"differentCountries": {
				"question": "How does it handle different countries?",
				"answer": "The optimizer uses your selected country and region to load the appropriate holidays and calculate optimal days around them. Different countries have different holiday calendars."
			},
			"alternativeDays": {
				"question": "What are alternative days?",
				"answer": "When you hover over a suggested day, alternatives are shown that generate the exact same number of effective days and adjacent holidays, but don't overlap with other suggestions."
			},
			"weekendCustomization": {
				"question": "Can I customize weekend days?",
				"answer": "Currently, the optimizer uses Saturday-Sunday as weekends. Customizable weekends (e.g., Friday-Saturday for Middle East) are planned for future updates."
			},
			"partialPto": {
				"question": "What if I don't want to use all my PTO days?",
				"answer": "Enter fewer PTO days than you actually have. For example, if you have 25 days but only want to optimize 15, enter 15 in the PTO field."
			}
		},
		"limitations": {
			"algorithmType": {
				"question": "Does it guarantee the mathematically optimal solution?",
				"answer": "No, the optimizer uses a greedy algorithm that finds very good solutions quickly, but doesn't guarantee the mathematically optimal global solution. It tries 3 different strategies and picks the best result."
			},
			"maxAlternatives": {
				"question": "How many alternatives are shown?",
				"answer": "Maximum 10 alternatives per block (limited by efficiency). The system prioritizes showing the most relevant alternatives with exact matching criteria."
			},
			"personalPreferences": {
				"question": "Does it consider personal preferences?",
				"answer": "Currently no. It doesn't account for preferences like avoiding certain months, travel constraints, or specific personal events. Future versions will include customizable preferences."
			},
			"externalEvents": {
				"question": "Can it optimize around external or missing events?",
				"answer": "Yes, you can add custom, missing, or incorrect holidays. This is a premium feature"
			},
			"fixedPto": {
				"question": "Can I use only part of my PTO allowance?",
				"answer": "The current version requires using all specified PTO days. Partial PTO usage options are planned for future releases."
